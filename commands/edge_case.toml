<goal>
Generate a structured list of edge cases for the feature below, starting from high-level auth/flow scenarios down to detailed component states and interactions.
</goal>

<coverage>
Think in layers. For each item below, list concrete edge cases (short bullet points), not general advice.

1) High-level scenarios
- Auth vs no auth: logged-in, logged-out, session expired, revoked access.
- Roles / plans: admin vs regular, free vs paid, restricted roles.
- New vs existing: first-time user, user with historical data.
- Platforms / locales: web vs mobile, different regions if relevant.
- Language / locale: different languages may enable/disable features, varying character sets, RTL vs LTR layouts.

2) Core flows
- Success / happy path:
  - What “success” means and possible variants (full vs partial completion).
- Failure flows:
  - Input/validation errors.
  - Backend errors: 4xx, 5xx, timeouts, dependency failures.
  - Business rule failures: limits, quotas, policy blocks.
- Recovery:
  - Retry, undo/cancel, resume after refresh/reopen, resume after fixing input or network.

3) Auth & security
- No auth: anonymous access limits, upgrade/redirect paths.
- Auth failures: missing/invalid/expired tokens, forced logout, password/SSO issues.
- Authorization: forbidden actions, cross-tenant or cross-user data access attempts.
- Region/privacy: restricted data by region, masked fields, consent not given.

4) Data & state
- Data volume: none/empty, small, very large datasets.
- Data quality: inconsistent, corrupted, stale client cache vs fresh server values.
- Time-based: expired entities (offers, links), timezone differences, scheduling near boundaries (day/month/year/DST).

5) Component / UI / API states
For key screens/components or endpoints, consider:
- Initial/default.
- Loading / in-progress.
- Empty / no data.
- Error (client-side and server-side).
- Offline / no network / flaky network.
- Overflow / extremes:
  - Very long text, many items, huge numbers, large files.
- Boundary inputs:
  - Min/max length, special characters, emojis, different languages/scripts.
  - Unsupported file types/sizes or invalid formats.

6) Interactions
- User behavior:
  - Rapid clicks / double submit, spammy input, back/forward navigation.
  - Refresh or close mid-flow, multiple tabs/windows/devices.
- Cancellations:
  - User cancels in the middle of long-running actions.
- Concurrency:
  - Two users editing same resource.
  - Same user acting on same resource from multiple sessions.

7) Technical / platform
- Network:
  - No connection, high latency, timeouts, partial responses, retry storms.
- Dependencies:
  - Third-party APIs down/slow, feature flags toggled during use.
- Storage:
  - Local storage/cookies disabled or full, server-side quota/rate limits.
- Versioning:
  - Old client with new API, new client with old API, partial rollouts.
