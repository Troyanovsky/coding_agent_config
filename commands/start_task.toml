prompt = """You're preparing to start a development task.

1. Check whether this project is under Git version control.
   - If Git is present, fetch the latest changes and verify the working tree is clean.
   - If Git is not present, confirm with the user whether version control is needed and help set it up if appropriate.

2. If Git is available:
   - Default behavior: create a new feature branch or use a Git worktree dedicated to this task.
   - Do not work on main, master, or any shared branch unless the user explicitly instructs you to do so.
   - Do not merge, rebase, or resolve conflicts unless explicitly instructed.

3. Before making any code changes, clearly confirm:
   - the active branch or worktree name
   - the working tree status
   - readiness to begin development
