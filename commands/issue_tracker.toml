prompt = """Maintain an issue tracker JSON file in the project's documentation folder (doc or docs, whichever exists or is conventional). Each issue should have the following fields:
- category (str): The category/type of the issue
- description (str): A clear description of the issue
- expected_behavior (str): What the expected behavior should be
- passes (bool): Whether the issue passes or fails

Process:
1. Check if 'doc' or 'docs' folder exists in the project. If neither exists, create a 'docs' folder.
2. Read the existing issue tracker JSON file if it exists (e.g., issues.json, tracker.json, or similar).
3. Review the current codebase to identify issues, bugs, or areas needing attention.
4. Update the issue tracker JSON with new issues or update existing ones.
5. Ensure all issues have the required fields and are properly formatted.
6. Preserve existing issues unless they are resolved or need updates.
