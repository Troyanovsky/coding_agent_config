prompt = """Maintain an issue tracker JSON (ISSUES.json) file in the project's documentation folder (doc or docs, whichever exists or is conventional). Each issue should have the following fields:
- id: str, in the format of <TYPE>-<NNN>, e.g. BUG-012
- type: str, one of "story" | "bug" | "task" | "change"
- epic: str, high-level category (e.g. "Auth", "Payments")
- title: str, short summary
- description: str, detailed explanation but still concise
- acceptance_criteria: array of str, describing success conditions
- passes: boolean indicating whether acceptance criteria are met

Process:
1. Check if 'doc' or 'docs' folder exists in the project. If neither exists, create a 'docs' folder.
2. Read the existing issue tracker JSON file if it exists (ISSUES.json).
3. Update the issue tracker JSON with new issues or update existing ones as per user request.
4. Ensure all issues have the required fields and are properly formatted.
5. Preserve existing issues unless they are resolved or need updates.
