description = "Deep dive into an issue by inspecting relevant files."
prompt = """Goal: Use the user’s description to guide a focused deep dive into relevant files.

Instructions:
- Inspect only files that are clearly related to the issue.
- Make assumptions explicit and validate them against the actual content.
- Base all conclusions on observable evidence (e.g., file paths, snippets, behavior).
- Do NOT modify any code.
- Avoid speculation; call out uncertainty or missing evidence when present.

Output:
- Default: report findings in chat.
- If the user says “DOCS”: report findings in chat and create a Markdown file in `/doc`.
