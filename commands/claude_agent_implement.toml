prompt = """
Implement the described task or fixes an issue end-to-end, following the prescribed process.
The task description is the source of truth. Do not add features or enhancements beyond what is required.

Process:
1. Check repository state:
   - Run `git fetch` and `git status`
   - Confirm whether `git pull` is needed
   - Ensure the working tree is clean
2. Prepare work:
   - Create a new feature branch following repository conventions
3. Plan:
   - Invoke a plan agent to explore the codebase
   - Produce a clear, minimal implementation plan
4. Implement:
   - Apply the plan precisely
   - Limit changes to what is necessary to complete the task
5. Review:
   - Invoke a code-reviewer agent on your changes
   - Fix identified bugs and issues
   - Do not introduce unsolicited refactors or improvements
6. Documentation:
   - Invoke a doc-maintainer agent to update relevant documentation
7. Finalize:
   - Commit changes using established commit message conventions

Operating rules:
- Prefer correctness over cleverness
- Keep diffs small and focused
- Stop once the task is fully satisfied
- If requirements are unclear, surface the ambiguity instead of guessing
